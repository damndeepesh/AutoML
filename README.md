# AutoML & Explainability Web Application

This Streamlit web application empowers users to perform end-to-end machine learning tasks with ease. Upload your data, automatically train and compare various models, understand their predictions through SHAP explainability, and export the best model for your needs.

## üéØ Core Objectives

*   **Accessibility**: Enable users of all technical backgrounds to leverage machine learning.
*   **Automation**: Streamline the ML pipeline from data ingestion to model evaluation.
*   **Transparency**: Provide clear insights into model behavior using SHAP.
*   **Efficiency**: Quickly identify the best-performing model for a given dataset.

## ‚ú® Key Features

*   **Flexible Data Upload**: 
    *   Supports `.csv` and `.xlsx` files.
    *   Option to upload a single file (for automatic train/test splitting) or separate training and testing files.
*   **Data Preprocessing**: 
    *   Automatic handling of missing values (imputation).
    *   Encoding of categorical features.
    *   Optional scaling of numeric features.
*   **Target Column & Problem Type Detection**: 
    *   Easy selection of the target variable.
    *   Automatic detection of problem type (Classification/Regression).
    *   Auto-detection of common target column names.
*   **Automated Model Training & Comparison**: 
    *   Trains a suite of models tailored to the problem type:
        *   **Classification**: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, SVM, K-Nearest Neighbors, Gaussian Naive Bayes.
        *   **Regression**: Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, ElasticNet, Decision Tree Regressor, Random Forest Regressor, Gradient Boosting Regressor, SVR, K-Nearest Neighbors Regressor.
    *   Displays a leaderboard with key performance metrics (Accuracy, F1, AUC for classification; R2, MSE for regression).
*   **Model Explainability (XAI)**: 
    *   Utilizes SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) for the best model.
    *   Global feature importance plots.
    *   Detailed SHAP summary plots (e.g., beeswarm) and individual prediction explanations (waterfall plots coming soon).
*   **Model Export**: Download the trained best model (including preprocessing steps) as a `.joblib` file for deployment or further use.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup & Installation

1.  **Prerequisites**: Python 3.7+ installed.
2.  **Clone the Repository (Optional)**:
    ```bash
    # git clone <your_repository_url> # If you have it on Git
    # cd AutoML-WebApp
    ```
    Alternatively, ensure `app.py` and `requirements.txt` are in your project directory.
3.  **Create and Activate Virtual Environment (Recommended)**:
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # macOS/Linux
    # venv\Scripts\activate    # Windows
    ```
4.  **Install Dependencies**:

    *   Feature selection techniques.
*   **Hyperparameter Tuning**: 
    *   Integration of GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV for optimizing model hyperparameters.
    *   User interface to define search spaces.
*   **Expanded Model Support**: 
    *   LightGBM, XGBoost, CatBoost for both classification and regression.
    *   Basic Time Series forecasting models (e.g., ARIMA, Prophet) if applicable data is provided.
*   **Enhanced Evaluation & Visualization**: 
    *   Interactive Confusion Matrix, ROC/AUC curves, Precision-Recall curves for classification.
    *   Residual plots, Actual vs. Predicted plots for regression.
    *   Cross-validation score details.
*   **Deployment & Integration**: 
    *   Option to generate a simple Flask API endpoint for the exported model.
